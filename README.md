# Indigitall Push Notification

ndigitall services only work over HTTPS, which is a secure version of the HTTP protocol. This means your website must use an SSL certificate and load with 'https://' in the URL. Without HTTPS, Indigitall features like push notifications will not function, as they require a secure connection to protect user data and ensure proper delivery.
